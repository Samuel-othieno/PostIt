# Template Directory

## Overview
The `template` directory contains the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that serve as the blueprint for the user interface of the PostIt application. These files were created as part of Challenge 1 to design the initial UI using HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap.

- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework used to create responsive and mobile-first web pages.
- **Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB)**: Framework used to enhance the UI with Material Design components.

## Files
- **index.html**: Contains the user registration/login form.
- **groups.html**: Contains the form for creating broadcast groups and adding users.
- **post_message.html**: Contains the form for posting messages to groups.
- **message_board.html**: Contains the message board to view messages posted to groups.
