## Overview
The `client` directory contains the frontend code for the PostIt application. This code is responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user interactions, and making API calls to the backend. The frontend is built using React and Redux.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management library for managing global state.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Official, recommended way to write Redux logic.
- **React-Redux**: Official React bindings for Redux.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Vite**: Build tool for faster and more efficient development.
- **Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB)**: Framework used to enhance the UI with Material Design components.

## Files
- **src/index.js**: Entry point for the React application.
- **src/App.js**: Main App component that renders the application.
- **src/store.js**: Redux store configuration using Redux Toolkit.
- **src/reducers/userReducer.js**: Redux slice for managing user state.
- **src/reducers/groupReducer.js**: Redux slice for managing group state.
